# Alzheimers_Facial_Recognition

# Description of Project : 

Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, a term used for memory loss as well as
personâ€™s intellectual abilities serious enough that interfere with daily life. For example, people
diagnose with Alzheimer, over period of time, loses ability to remember and recognize their
family members. In this project you will implement a simple face recognizer, which gives these
patients ability to recognize faces. Think of a mobile phone facing the world, either hanging or

picture, detecting faces and recognizing them through face recognizer can assist patients through
normal course of conversation.
